# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification
## 📌 Overview

This project classifies iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Using machine learning, we build a classification model to predict the species based on given flower measurements.

## 🔍 Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and preparing the dataset for training.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing feature distributions and correlations using scatter plots and pair plots.

Model Training & Evaluation: Implementing classification models such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, and F1-score for model evaluation.

## 📂 Dataset
The Iris Dataset, originally introduced by Ronald Fisher, is available in the Scikit-learn library and contains 150 samples with 50 instances for each species.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda)

Libraries Used:

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn

## 🚀 How to Run

Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-flower-classification.git
cd iris-flower-classification
Set Up the Environment (Anaconda Recommended)
conda create --name iris-classification python=3.8
